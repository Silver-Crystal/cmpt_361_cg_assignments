Line Rasterisation
2.00 / 2.00
Description	
2pt: correct handling of all orientations and all low/high start and end point combinations

1pt: implementation that functions correctly in only some cases

0pt: no implementation, or implementation does not function correctly in any case

Comment	
Linear colour interpolation
1.00 / 1.00
Description	
1pt: correct linear interpolation of color along line from start to end

0pt: no implementation, or implementation does not function correctly in any case

Comment	
Triangle inside-outside test
3.00 / 3.00
Description	
3pt: fully correct implementation, handling all triangle test cases

2pt: implementation with some errors or artifacts in test cases (e.g., gaps between triangles with shared edge)

1pt: implementation attempted but fails to reliably determine inside-outside in most cases (e.g., no visible triangles rasterized)

0pt: no implementation, or implementation does not function correctly in any case

Comment	
Triangle rasterization
2.00 / 2.00
Description	
2pt: fully correct implementation with bounding box check to avoid checking all points

1pt: correct implementation but no bounding box check

0pt: no implementation, or implementation does not function correctly in any case

Comment	
Barycentric color interpolatio
2.00 / 2.00
Description	
2pt: fully correct implementation interpolating colors in all test cases

1pt: implementation that functions correctly in only some cases

0pt: no implementation, or implementation does not function correctly in any case
