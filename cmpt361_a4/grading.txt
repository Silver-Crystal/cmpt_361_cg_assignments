Triangle mesh generation
3.00 / 3.00
Description	
- 3pt: fully correct implementation of all attributes for both cube and sphere triangle meshes: `positions`, `normals`, `uvCoords` (and `indices` for sphere are all populated correctly)
- 2pt: one erroneous or missing attribute in cube or sphere mesh generation
- 1pt: two erroneous or missing attributes in both cube and sphere mesh generation
- 0pt: no implementation, or implementation does not function correctly in any case

Transformations
2.00 / 2.00
Description	
- 2pt: implementation handles all transform sequences correctly
- 1pt: implementation fails to correctly handle some transformations
- 0pt: no implementation, or implementation does not function correctly in any case

Shading
2.00 / 3.00
Description	
- 3pt: fully correct implementation, handling all three Blinn-Phong shading terms (ambient, diffuse, specular)
- 2pt: mostly correct implementation (some errors or artifacts in one of the three terms)
- 1pt: implementation attempted but there are more than one errors or errors in more than one of the three terms
- 0pt: no implementation, or implementation does not function correctly in any case

specular off

Texturing
2.00 / 2.00
Description	
- 2pt: fully correct implementation matching sample output for both cube and sphere meshes (note: if errors in `uvCoords` already penalized in the first part, no penalty again here; i.e. assume correct uvCoords for texturing)
- 1pt: partially correct implementation (textures nor modulated by shading color, textures appear but do not match placement according to instructions etc.)
- 0pt: no implementation, or implementation does not function correctly in any case
